## TL;DR

- The statistics of the RPG are explained [here]()

## Background
I've been an occasional tabletop RPG player for years. My favorite teenage PC games were Neverwinter Nights and a Russian mod for Dungeon Siege called "Ледяной ветер" (funny story - I found it on a street market during a school trip to St. Petersburg circa 2003), so D&D was a natural first step when I turned to tabletop games. But I quickly realised that the convoluted game mechanics and strict world rules made it relatively hard to play for my taste. In search for more flexible systems that gave a bit more room for imagination and improvisation, I was introduced by a friend to World of Darkness and its Vampire games. It was a definite improvement, since the simpler rules allowed for a faster-paced gameplay. The games also tended to be both less exuberant and subtler than D&D adventures, with an increased focus on strategising and negotiation. However, in the end, you are still playing a vampire, which can get pretty boring in the long run.

So I switched gears one again and started playing with a more experimental crowd, especially one of my DM friends that produced stories I can only describe as psychanalitic-political goth dystopias, whatever that may mean. Somewhere between Judge Dredd and Takashi Miike movies with an emo element, if that makes sense to you. The focus was now almost fully narrative, with little or no combat. Disoriented characters were thrown into strange, dysfunctional worlds with complex faction systems which they had to explore, make sense of and ultimately exploit. You didn't need a complex rulebook for these kind of stories, and I remember several occasions where the DM just ignored our throws in order to let us succeed at a key task, just for the needs of the story. At the time, we were using the Storytelling system, which is derived from World of Darkness rules. Quickly, we switched to Risus, a one-page system originally designed for more ironic/non-serious stories, which offers extreme flexibility.

Risus and Storytelling were the two systems I experimented with when I started DM-ing myself, along with other free-form RPGs such as Fate or GURPS. 
My first large-scale attempt was the "Dreamscape" game, which was inspired by the oniric-psychedelic universe of Philip K. Dick and Frank Herbert short stories, and the "Alien Keys" storyline, which draws from the short-lived and now defunct HBO miniseries "The Lost Room" (which I highly recommend, despite the terrible acting). Both had the same, very minimalist syste

The surprising organisational nightmare of trying to organise regular meetups between otherwise sociable twentysomethings. 

### Why another system?
