Hi, I'm Arthur Gilly, Head of Analytics at the Institute of Translational Genomics, which is based at the Helmholtz Centre in Munich. Previously, I worked as a bioinformatician at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge.

Here you'll find a bric-a-brac of some <a href="{{ site.url }}/play/index.html"> hobby activities and DIY projects</a>, and the occasional <a href="{{ site.url }}/work/index.html">work-related project</a> (stuff I'm not really supposed to be working on).

I write the occasional non-technical article on my Medium blog [In Good Measure](https://medium.com/in-good-measure) (under a pen name).

This website was built using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, and is based on a customised version of the [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) for Jekyll theme written by Cole Townsend.
